# React-SASS-Boilerplate
Boilerplate for react-sass aplications. No create-react-app needed.

## Install
### Using npx
You can start working with this boilerplate with: `npx react-sass app-name`

The app structure will be automatically generated, and you're ready to code!

### Using git
You can use `git clone` aswell if you wish.

To use boilerplate via **git**, do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/VCAngel/React-SASS-Boilerplate app-name
cd app-name
npm i -D
```

## Run webpack live server
To run the live server provided by webpack, do the following:
`npm run start`, or just run `npm start`

Your app will launch on development mode in your configured port.

## Why?
Idk, but we can skip general webpack configuration with this! 

**Feel free to use it!**
